**ZIBOKeyboardInput** is a high-performance native C++ X-Plane plugin that revolutionizes flight management computer interaction for the popular ZIBO 737 aircraft. This plugin eliminates the tedious point-and-click FMC operation by enabling direct keyboard input, allowing pilots to type flight plans, waypoints, and navigation data directly into the FMC using their physical keyboard.

The plugin features intelligent aircraft detection, dual FMC support for both pilot positions, real-time visual feedback, and seamless integration with X-Plane's command system. Built from the ground up in C++ for optimal performance and stability, it provides a more realistic and efficient flight simulation experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚å®Ô∏è **Direct Keyboard Input**: Type directly into ZIBO 737 FMC using your keyboard
- üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è **Dual FMC Support**: Switch between Captain and First Officer FMC positions
- üéØ **Visual Indicators**: Real-time display showing active FMC position and status
- üîç **Aircraft Auto-Detection**: Automatically activates only when ZIBO 737 (ICAO: B738) is loaded
- üîß **Custom Commands**: X-Plane commands for easy key binding and joystick integration
- üöÄ **Native Performance**: C++ implementation for optimal performance and stability
- üéõÔ∏è **Intelligent Key Mapping**: Advanced key mapping with special character support (plus signs, minus signs, etc.)
- üíæ **Cross-Platform**: Universal support for macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon), Windows, and Linux

## üéØ How It Works

The plugin seamlessly integrates with X-Plane's input system to provide natural keyboard-to-FMC interaction:

1. **Auto-Detection**: When you load the ZIBO 737, the plugin automatically detects the aircraft and becomes available
2. **Toggle Activation**: Use custom keyboard shortcuts to toggle input for Captain or First Officer FMC
3. **Direct Input**: Once enabled, simply type on your keyboard - letters, numbers, and symbols appear directly in the FMC
4. **Visual Feedback**: A small status indicator shows which FMC position is active
5. **Smart Filtering**: The plugin only captures relevant keys, allowing normal X-Plane shortcuts to work unchanged

This eliminates the need for tedious mouse clicking on FMC buttons, making flight planning faster and more realistic.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS 10.15 or higher, Windows 10+, or Linux
- **X-Plane**: X-Plane 11 or X-Plane 12 (supports XPLM 410+ SDK)
- **Aircraft**: ZIBO 737 (ICAO: B738)
- **Development Tools**: 
  - Xcode Command Line Tools (macOS)
  - CMake 3.16 or higher

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Xcode Command Line Tools (macOS)
xcode-select --install

# Install CMake (using Homebrew)
brew install cmake
```

### 2. Build Plugin

```bash
# Clone or download this project
cd ZIBOKeyboardInput

# Build plugin
./build.sh

# Or clean and rebuild
./build.sh clean
```

### 3. Install Plugin

```bash
# Auto-install to X-Plane directory
./install.sh

# Or manually specify X-Plane path
./install.sh "/Applications/X-Plane 12"
```

After successful build, the plugin file `mac.xpl` will be installed to:
```
X-Plane/Resources/plugins/ZIBOKeyboardInput/mac.xpl
```

## üìñ Detailed Documentation

### Key Mappings

When keyboard input is enabled, the following keys are mapped to FMC buttons:

| Keyboard Key | FMC Function | Description |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0-9 | Numbers 0-9 | Numeric input |
| A-Z | Letters A-Z | Alphabetic input |
| Backspace | CLR | Clear last character |
| Space | SP | Space character |
| Delete | DEL | Delete function |
| / (main or numpad) | Slash | Forward slash |
| . | Period | Decimal point |
| - (main or numpad) | Minus | Minus sign |
| Shift + = | Plus* | Plus sign (special handling) |
| Numpad + | Plus* | Plus sign (special handling) |

*_Note: Plus signs use a special double-minus technique to work with ZIBO FMC's internal logic_

### Custom Commands

The plugin provides two X-Plane commands that you can bind to keyboard shortcuts or joystick buttons:

- `Zibo/ZIBO_Keyboard/Toggle_Keyboard_Input_Captain` - Toggle Captain FMC keyboard input
- `Zibo/ZIBO_Keyboard/Toggle_Keyboard_Input_FO` - Toggle First Officer FMC keyboard input

### Visual Indicators

When keyboard input is active, you will see:
- **Bottom-right corner**: Floating status window with green "KB:CAP" or "KB:FO" indicator
- **Real-time feedback**: The indicator appears only when input is enabled and automatically hides when disabled
- **Aircraft-specific**: Only displays when ZIBO 737 is loaded and plugin is active

### Usage Instructions

1. Load the ZIBO 737 aircraft in X-Plane
2. Assign keyboard shortcuts to the plugin commands in X-Plane Settings > Keyboard
3. Press your assigned key to toggle keyboard input for Captain or First Officer FMC
4. When enabled, type directly - characters will appear in the active FMC
5. Toggle off when finished or to switch between positions

## üéÆ Usage Tips

### Best Practices
- Use the plugin only when actively entering data into the FMC
- Toggle off keyboard input when not needed to avoid interference
- Bind commands to easily accessible keys for quick toggling

### Troubleshooting

#### Plugin Not Loading
- Verify the plugin is in the correct directory: `X-Plane/Resources/plugins/ZIBOKeyboardInput/`
- Check X-Plane's Log.txt for error messages
- Ensure the plugin file has the correct extension (`.xpl`)

#### Keyboard Input Not Working
- Confirm you're using the ZIBO 737 (other 737s are not supported)
- Verify keyboard input is enabled (look for the red indicator)
- Check that the FMC is powered and operational
- Try toggling the input off and on again

#### Commands Not Appearing
- Restart X-Plane after installing the plugin
- Search for commands starting with "Zibo" in Settings > Keyboard

## üîß Technical Overview

This plugin operates by:
1. **Aircraft Detection**: Monitors the `sim/aircraft/view/acf_ICAO` dataref to detect ZIBO 737 (B738)
2. **Key Interception**: Registers a key sniffer callback to capture keyboard input
3. **Command Translation**: Maps virtual key codes to ZIBO FMC button commands (`laminar/B738/button/fmc1_*` or `laminar/B738/button/fmc2_*`)
4. **Visual Feedback**: Creates floating status windows showing active FMC position
5. **Smart Filtering**: Ignores modifier key combinations to prevent interference with X-Plane shortcuts

### Special Character Handling
- **Plus Signs**: Uses a sophisticated double-minus technique since ZIBO FMC toggles between minus and plus on repeated presses
- **Dual Input Support**: Both main keyboard and numpad keys are supported for maximum compatibility
- **Modifier Key Safety**: Prevents accidental FMC input when using keyboard shortcuts
