## üöÄ Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/6639835/ZIBOKeyboardInput.git
   cd ZIBOKeyboardInput
   ```

2. **Install development dependencies**

   **macOS:**
   ```bash
   # Install Xcode Command Line Tools
   xcode-select --install
   
   # Install CMake via Homebrew
   brew install cmake
   ```

   **Windows:**
   - Install Visual Studio 2019 or later (Community edition is sufficient)
   - Install CMake from cmake.org
   - Ensure Git is available

   **Linux:**
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential cmake libgl1-mesa-dev git
   
   # CentOS/RHEL/Fedora  
   sudo dnf install gcc-c++ cmake mesa-libGL-devel git
   ```

3. **Set up X-Plane SDK**
   - Download the latest X-Plane SDK from [developer.x-plane.com](https://developer.x-plane.com/)
   - Extract to project root as `XPLM-SDK/`
   - Verify directory structure matches the one shown in `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

4. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   # Quick build
   ./build.sh
   
   # Or manual build
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
   cmake --build . --config Debug
   ```

5. **Test your build**
   - Install the plugin using `./install.sh`
   - Load X-Plane with ZIBO 737
   - Test basic functionality

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### C++ Coding Standards

- **Formatting**: Use consistent indentation (4 spaces, no tabs)
- **Naming conventions**:
  - Variables: `snake_case` (e.g., `g_fmc_side`, `aircraft_icao`)
  - Functions: `snake_case` (e.g., `draw_callback`, `key_sniffer`)
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `PLUGIN_NAME`, `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`)
  - Classes/Structs: `PascalCase` (if any are added)

- **Comments**: 
  - Use `//` for single-line comments
  - Use `/* */` for multi-line comments
  - Document complex logic and X-Plane specific interactions
  - Include function headers for non-trivial functions

- **File structure**:
  - Platform definitions at the top
  - XPLM includes after platform definitions
  - Standard library includes
  - Global variables clearly marked
  - Helper functions before main plugin functions

### Example Code Style

```cpp
// Good example
static int g_toggled = 0;           // Global state: 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled
static XPLMDataRef g_icao_dataref = NULL;

/**
 * Checks if the current aircraft is ZIBO 737
 * Returns 1 if ZIBO is loaded, 0 otherwise
 */
static int is_zibo_loaded() {
    if (!g_icao_dataref) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    char aircraft_icao[40];
    XPLMGetDatab(g_icao_dataref, aircraft_icao, 0, sizeof(aircraft_icao));
    
    return (strcmp(aircraft_icao, "B738") == 0);
}
```

### X-Plane Plugin Specific Guidelines

- **Memory management**: Always check for NULL pointers when working with datarefs
- **Error handling**: Use defensive programming - validate all X-Plane SDK inputs
- **Resource cleanup**: Properly unregister callbacks and release resources in plugin disable
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Test `#ifdef` blocks for APL/IBM/LIN
- **Performance**: Minimize work in flight loop callbacks
- **SDK usage**: Prefer newer XPLM APIs when available, maintain backward compatibility

## üêõ Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

### Required Information
- **X-Plane version** (11 or 12, exact build number)
- **Operating system** (macOS version, Windows version, Linux distribution)
- **ZIBO 737 version** (if relevant)
- **Plugin version** (from VERSION file)
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected vs actual behavior**

### Additional Helpful Information
- **X-Plane Log.txt** (especially relevant sections)
- **Screenshots or videos** if the issue is visual
- **Other plugins** loaded that might conflict
- **System specifications** (especially for performance issues)

### Example Bug Report

```markdown
**Environment:**
- X-Plane: 12.1.0 (build 12345)
- OS: macOS 13.5.2 (M2 MacBook Pro)
- ZIBO: 3.50.17
- Plugin: v1.0.7

**Issue:**
Keyboard input stops working after switching from Captain to FO FMC.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Load ZIBO 737
2. Enable Captain FMC keyboard input
3. Type some text (works correctly)
4. Toggle to FO FMC input
5. Try typing - nothing appears

**Expected:** FO FMC should receive keyboard input
**Actual:** No input is registered

**Additional Info:**
- Visual indicator shows "KB:FO" correctly
- Log.txt shows no errors
- Restarting X-Plane fixes the issue temporarily
```

  - [ ] Letters (A-Z)
  - [ ] Special characters (/, ., -, +)
  - [ ] Backspace (CLR)
  - [ ] Space (SP)
  - [ ] Delete (DEL)
- [ ] **Edge cases**:

- **Windows**: Windows 10/11 with X-Plane 11 and 12
- **Linux**: At least one major distribution

### Performance Testing

- Monitor X-Plane frame rate impact
- Test with other plugins loaded
- Verify no memory leaks during extended use

## üìã Feature Requests

When proposing new features:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Describe the use case** clearly
3. **Explain the expected behavior**
4. **Consider implementation complexity**
5. **Think about backward compatibility**

### Good Feature Request Example

```markdown
**Feature:** Support for additional ZIBO variants

**Use Case:** 
Some users fly ZIBO 737 MAX variants that use different ICAO codes.

**Proposed Solution:**
Extend aircraft detection to recognize additional ICAO codes like B38M, B39M.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Modify `is_zibo_loaded()` function to check multiple ICAO codes
- Maintain compatibility with existing B738 detection
- Consider configuration file for user-defined aircraft codes

**Backward Compatibility:**
Fully backward compatible - existing B738 functionality unchanged.
```

## üîí Security Guidelines

While this is a flight simulator plugin, please still follow security best practices:

- **Input validation**: Always validate external inputs (datarefs, file paths)
- **Buffer safety**: Use safe string functions (`strncpy`, `snprintf`)
- **Memory safety**: Check for NULL pointers and array bounds
- **Resource management**: Properly clean up allocated resources

## üìö Documentation Guidelines

When contributing documentation:

- **Be clear and concise**: Write for users of all experience levels
- **Use consistent formatting**: Follow existing markdown style
- **Include examples**: Show concrete examples where helpful
- **Keep it updated**: Ensure documentation matches current functionality
- **Consider non-native English speakers**: Use simple, clear language

## üåç Platform-Specific Considerations

### macOS
- Test on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs when possible
- Be aware of Gatekeeper and code signing requirements
- Consider macOS version compatibility (minimum 10.15)

### Windows
- Test on both X-Plane 11 and 12 if possible
- Be aware of Windows Defender potentially flagging unsigned plugins
- Consider Visual Studio version compatibility

### Linux
- Test on major distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS/RHEL, Arch)
- Be aware of library dependency differences
- Consider both X11 and Wayland environments
